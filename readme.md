# PowderRS
I'm doing tpt clones in every new lang I learn now :P

## Compilation
1. Install rust if you haven't already: https://rustup.rs/
2. Clone the repo
3. Open a terminal in the main directory of the cloned repo
4. Install rust nightly: `rustup toolchain install nightly`
5. Use rust nightly in this project: `rustup override set nightly`
6. Build and run the project: `cargo run --release`
